# ConfigCat React SDK Sample App

This application demostrates the ConfigCat React SDK usage through a simple React app.

## Build & Run:

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run sample app

```
npm start
```

3. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble running the `npm start`:

Sample app dependencies conflict sometimes with the SDK root dependencies.
Make sure the `/react-sdk/node_modules` is deleted before running `npm start` on `/react-sdk/samples/react-sdk-sample`.
